          I've lived in the Tricity long enough to know the spots that don't
          make it into guidebooks. The bar where locals actually go on Friday
          nights. The beach that's empty when the tourist ones are packed. The
          neighborhood where the best food hides behind the least impressive
          doors.

          Helgro isn't a tour company. It's more like having a friend who
          happens to know the city inside out. I build experiences around what
          you're into - whether that's history, food, nightlife, nature, or
          just wandering with no plan at all.

        <Text tag="p" variant="textSM">
          Every trip is different because every person is different. No scripts,
          no crowds, no tourist traps. Just the real Gdansk, Sopot, and Gdynia
          - the way they're meant to be experienced.
