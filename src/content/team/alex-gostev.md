  I've lived in the Tricity long enough to know the spots that don't make it into guidebooks. The bar where locals actually go on Friday nights. The beach that's empty when the tourist ones are packed.

  Helgro isn't a tour company. It's more like having a friend who happens to know Gdansk, Sopot, and Gdynia inside out. Every trip is different because every person is different.
