bio: |
  Sofia Ramirez is a project architect specializing in adaptive reuse and community-focused housing. She leads concept-to-CA delivery, coordinating consultants and translating early narratives into clear details and schedules.

  Her work centers low-carbon assemblies, mass timber, and passive strategies, using daylight and thermal simulation to inform envelope decisions. She pairs physical mockups with parametric studies to iterate quickly without losing craft.

  Sofia’s recent projects include a net-zero infill complex and the transformation of a historic warehouse into a flexible arts hub. She mentors interns and advances the studio’s material library with vetted, healthy products.
