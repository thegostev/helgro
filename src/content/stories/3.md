## Environmental Impact Assessment for Interiors

Our environmental impact assessment services for interior design provide comprehensive evaluation of the environmental consequences of interior material and design choices. We identify potential impacts, develop mitigation strategies, and ensure sustainable interior practices.

### Assessment Scope

- **Material Impact**: Analysis of resource use, emissions, and lifecycle of interior materials.
- **Indoor Air Quality**: Evaluation of VOCs, off-gassing, and health impacts of interior finishes.
- **Energy Consumption**: Assessment of lighting, appliances, and systems energy use.
- **Waste Generation**: Impact of construction waste and material disposal in interiors.
- **Water Usage**: Evaluation of water use in interior systems and maintenance.
- **Indoor Environmental Quality**: Assessment of thermal comfort, lighting, and acoustic conditions.
